## 💻 Supported Distributions

Newfetch runs on **any Linux distribution** — it’s written in pure C, fast, and portable.

However, only the following distros have dedicated ASCII logos included in the source:

- 🟦 Arch Linux
    - 🟩 Manjaro
- 🟥 Debian
- 🟧 Ubuntu
- 🟦 Fedora
- 🟪 Gentoo

For all other distros, Newfetch will gracefully fall back to the classic **Tux** logo 🐧.
